## Introduction

`ZZZ_Calculator` is a damage calculator for Zenless Zone Zero.

It is **fully automatically**, no need to manully set skill sequence (if sequence mode needed, let us know)

All you need to do is edit equipment of your agents, select a proper APL, then click run.

It provides a user-friendly interface to calculate the total damage output of a team composition, taking into account the characteristics of each character's weapon and equipments. Based on the preset APL (Action Priority List), it **automatically simulates** the actions in the team, triggers buffs, records and analyzes the results, and generates report in visual charts and tables.

## Features
